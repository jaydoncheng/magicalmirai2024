# Songs metadata

Each song and their corresponding scene is represented as a .ts file in this folder.
The songs need to be listed in `index.ts` to loaded by `Globals`. A listing can be added manually in `index.ts`, or (preferably) through the `gensongs.sh` script in the project root directory. `gensongs.sh` also runs whenever `npm run build` or `npm run build-dev` is called.

## Keyframe format
TBD
